# LGA-Service-Finder
Service Finder developed for the Local Government Association to illustrate the power of data made interoperable via the [Open Referral UK](https://openreferraluk.org/) data standard.

This repository contains the source code for the LGA's [Service Finder](https://servicefinder.esd.org.uk/).

This is a pure JavaScript application that can run from any web server or S3 repository.

Configure the Service Finder via the [Developers page](https://servicefinder.esd.org.uk/developers) to reference any Open Referral UK comliant API endpoint, such as those shown in the [Open Referral UK Dashboard](https://openreferraluk.org/dashboard). Configure the mappings which drive searches using the LGA's list mappings web method or your own resorce with mappings in the same JSON format.

See the [About page](https://servicefinder.esd.org.uk/about) for more information.
